Crate Clash! is a 2D multiplayer platformer game made entirely in unity where two players battle it out in a dynamic arena. Players use WASD and arrow keys to move around,
interact with crates to get power-ups, and shoot at each other. Crates randomly spawn in the arena, and when a player interacts with a crate,
they can receive one of two power-ups: a machine gun or a rocket launcher. The objective is to outlast the opponent by strategically using movement,
interaction with the environment, and powerful weapons from crates.

Gameplay
Movement:

Player 1 uses the WASD keys to move and jump.

Player 2 uses the Arrow keys to move and jump.

W/A/D or Left/Right: Move left or right.

W/Up: Jump.

Shooting:

Player 1 can shoot using the Q key.
Player 2 can shoot using the P key.
Players can shoot continuously or in bursts, depending on the weapon they pick up from crates.

Interacting with Crates:

Crates randomly spawn across the arena.
Player 1 interacts with crates by pressing the E key.
Player 2 interacts with crates by pressing the O key.
When a player interacts with a crate, they receive a random power-up: either a machine gun or a rocket launcher.

Power-ups from Crates:

Machine Gun: Fires rapid bursts of bullets with moderate damage. Best used for quick engagements at medium range.
Rocket Launcher: Fires slow, powerful rockets that explode on impact. Deals high damage but has a slower fire rate. Best for long-range attacks or area control.
Objectives:

The goal of the game is to reduce your opponent's health to zero while using movement, positioning, and the power-ups from crates to your advantage.
The first player to successfully defeat the other wins the round.
